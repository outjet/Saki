# To-Do for Firebase Hosting Deployment

You need to re-authenticate your Firebase CLI session to allow the deployment to proceed.

1.  **Re-authenticate with Firebase:**
    Open your terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    firebase login --reauth
    ```
    This will likely open a browser window for you to log in with your Google account associated with the `emmonscasa` Firebase project. Follow the prompts to complete the authentication.

2.  **Deploy the project to Firebase Hosting:**
    Once you have successfully re-authenticated, run the following command in your terminal from the project root directory:
    ```bash
    firebase deploy --only hosting --project emmonscasa
    ```
    This command will deploy the static files generated by Next.js (located in the `out` directory) to the `emmonscasa` Firebase Hosting site.

After these steps are completed, your website should be live at `https://emmons.casa`.
